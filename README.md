# status
Status &amp; alarm log with bash and telegram bot.

Instruction:

1. Google `how to create telegram bot via @FatherBot`. Customize your bot (avatar, description and etc.) and `get bot API token`.

3. Create at least 2 channels: `alarm` and `log`. Customize them and `get chats IDs`.
4. Connect to your server and create `status` folder in the `$HOME directory`.
